_A brief introduction to_
# Our Vision and Values
_Disciples of Jesus | Pittsburgh, PA_
  1. We want to love the LORD our God with all our heart, soul, mind and 
    strength and love our neighbors as ourselves. This includes laying down 
    our lives for one another, as our Lord did for us, as well as proactively 
    loving our neighbors.
  2. We believe the sacred Scriptures intend to lead its readers to the living 
    Word, Jesus. We discover His will for us through personal and corporate 
    study and apply New Testament commands within our community.
  3. We strive to maintain a deep sense of dependence on Godâ€™s Holy Spirit 
    both individually and collectively. We believe that without the Spirit 
    of God, there is no spiritual life. We actively seek His presence and His 
    guidance within scriptural parameters.
  4. We realize our deep need for personal communion with God and intercession 
    for others. We pray often in our scheduled meetings and at other times.
  5. We want to fulfill our responsibility in sharing the Good News that Jesus 
    is King and to make disciples of Jesus.
  6. We believe in the blessing of accountability and fellowship with each 
    other while simultaneously remaining receptive to the input and example 
    of those in the broader body of Christ. As we speak into each other's 
    lives on subjects like: finances, vocations, investments, attire, 
    ministries and home life, we are finding that it works well to live in 
    close proximity. Although this type of accountability takes effort we 
    believe it to be beneficial and crucial to the life of disciples.
  7. We seek to live at peace with other followers of Jesus. When possible we 
    seek to build relationships and live in unity with other Christians who 
    endeavor to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Kingdom. We 
    identify with the historic faith and the pilgrim church.
  8. Those of us who have children seek to raise them in the discipline and 
  instruction of the Lord. We believe parents are responsible to choose 
  environments and influences that will encourage faith in God and obedience 
  to His will.
