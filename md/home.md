## Disciples of Jesus
**A “City on a Hill” in Brighton Heights, Pittsburgh, PA**


We are a community of disciples of Jesus, following Him with loving hearts
and living out all His teachings in faithful obedience.
We are ambassadors of God’s Kingdom in this broken world, making evident,
the wisdom, justice, and perfection of the reign of our eternal King Jesus.


Because we love our brothers and sisters,
our practice is informed by the historic Christian faith as well as the
faithful practice of contemporary Christians.  We aim to demonstrate,
both in words and actions, what the whole world would be like if
everyone obeyed our King.
